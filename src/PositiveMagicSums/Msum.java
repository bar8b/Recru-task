/**
    An array of integers, arr[n], can be rearranged arbitraily. The magicsum at index i is defined as
    msum[i] = arr[0] + arr[1] + ... + arr[i]
    Rearange array and maximize the number of elements greater than 0 in the msum array.
    Report the most number of elements greater than 0 out of the array msum

    Note: here, a positive value is defined as an integer value.
    Example:
    n = 4,
    arr = [-6,3,4,-10]
    One optional arrangement is [3,4,-6,-10]. This has an array of magic sums msum = [3,7,1,-9] with 3 numbers grater than 0.
    Return 3 as there is no way to have more than 3 positive elements.

    [2,0,1,-3] -> [2,2,3,0]

    [-3,0,-2] -> xxx
